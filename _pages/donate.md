I make the majority of my software available to the public and make sure that it is **secure** and **add-free**. One of my favorite projects that I've published is [Raivo](https://raivo-otp.com/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}, a Multi Factor Authenticator. It's available for free on the Apple App Store for iOS and MacOS. I also publish adversary simulation (a.k.a. red teaming) exploits and tools, such as [KernelMii](https://github.com/tijme/kernel-mii){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}, [CMSTPLUA UAC Bypass](https://github.com/tijme/cmstplua-uac-bypass){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} and an exploit for [AMD's Ryzen Master Driver](https://github.com/tijme/amd-ryzen-master-driver-v17-exploit){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}.

Because software such as Raivo is free and privacy friendly, more and more people are using it. Unfortunately for me, the costs are therefore slowly increasing. In addition to the time I spend developing, I spend money on an Apple Developer license, domain names and hosting for the issuer icons and Apple Push Notification proxy server.

If you or your company use Raivo or any of my other tools or exploits, please consider sponsoring me so I can continue maintaining and evolving all my projects and new ones.

Thank you for your support! üë®‚Äçüíª
