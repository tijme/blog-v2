I make the majority of my software available to the public and make sure that it is **(add-)free** and **secure**. One of my favorite projects that I've worked on is [Raivo](https://raivo-otp.com/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} (acquired), a Multi Factor Authenticator. I also publish adversary simulation (a.k.a. red teaming) exploits and tools, such as [KernelMii](https://github.com/tijme/kernel-mii){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}, [CMSTPLUA UAC Bypass](https://github.com/tijme/cmstplua-uac-bypass){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} and an exploit for [AMD's Ryzen Master Driver](https://github.com/tijme/amd-ryzen-master-driver-v17-exploit){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}.

Because the software I publish is (add-)free, secure and open source, usage slowly increases. Therefore, and unfortunately for me, for certain projects cost also slowly increases. In addition to the time I spend developing, I spend money on e.g. an Apple Developer license, domain names and hosting services.

If you or your company use any of my software or exploits, please consider sponsoring me so I can continue maintaining and evolving all my projects and new ones.

Thank you for your support! üë®‚Äçüíª
